# iPhone Duo — API index

Every API named across Apple's six iPhone Duo Tech Talks, grouped by job, with
the framework and the minimum SDK. Use this as a lookup table; the skills in
`../../` explain when and why to reach for each one.

## SDK gates

| Built against | What your app gets on iPhone Duo |
|---|---|
| Pre-iOS 27 | Runs fine. Closed: uses the space left of the status bar and camera. Open: familiar size and aspect ratio. |
| iOS 27 SDK | Extends to the left of the status bar area on the inner display. Existing resizing work pays off. |
| **iOS 27.1 SDK** | Full-screen: content reaches the screen edge, and standard navigation/toolbar buttons lay out **vertically** under the status bar. Unlocks reserved regions and arrangements. |

Tooling: **Xcode 27.1** → iPhone Duo simulator in **Device Hub**, with controls
to open, close, rotate and fold. The **App Resizability** skill in Xcode 27.1
(formerly the app modernization skill) now covers SwiftUI and iPhone Duo.

## Size classes, screens, shape

| Job | SwiftUI | UIKit |
|---|---|---|
| Read size class | `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)`, `@Environment(\.verticalSizeClass)` | `traitCollection.horizontalSizeClass` / `.verticalSizeClass` |
| Screen scale | environment / trait | `traitCollection.displayScale` |
| Get a screen at all | prefer not to | `window?.windowScene?.screen` |
| Match screen corners (iOS 26) | `ConcentricRectangle` | `UICornerConfiguration` |

**Avoid `UIScreen.main`.** It is ambiguous on a two-display device and is slated
for deprecation. Prefer environment values, trait collection, or scene bounds.

`UIRequiresFullScreen` is still honored, but the app still resizes when the
device opens and closes, including in Split View.

## Safe areas and reserved regions

| Job | SwiftUI | UIKit |
|---|---|---|
| Keep foreground in safe area | default behavior | `view.safeAreaInsets`, or the safe area layout guide |
| Let background bleed | `.ignoresSafeArea()` | `view.bounds` |
| Custom UI outside the safe area (iOS 27.1) | `ReservedRegion` | `UIViewReservedRegion` |
| Query regions (iOS 27.1) | `reservedRegions(kind:options:layoutDirectionBehavior:)` on a `GeometryProxy`, from `GeometryReader` or `onGeometryChange` | `reservedRegions(kind:options:)` on `UIView` |

The UIKit signature, verbatim:

```swift
@MainActor func reservedRegions(
    kind: UIView.ReservedRegion.Kind,
    options: UIView.ReservedRegion.QueryOptions = []
) -> [UIView.ReservedRegion]
```

The SwiftUI signature adds a layout-direction parameter:

```swift
func reservedRegions(
    kind: ReservedRegion.Kind,
    options: ReservedRegion.QueryOptions = [],
    layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior = .mirrors
) -> [ReservedRegion]
```

Region geometry is physical — the camera doesn't move for right-to-left
languages — so by default SwiftUI **mirrors** the frames for you, which suits a
custom `Layout`. Pass `.fixed` when you need the unmirrored frames.

Region kinds (`divisionRegionKind` / `occlusionRegionKind` in Objective-C):

- **`.division`** — splits an area into smaller areas. The fold is a division
  region. It is *active* only while the device is folded; when flat it is
  inactive with zero width.
- **`.occlusion`** — covers part of an area. The inner FaceTime camera is an
  occlusion region, active only while that camera is active.

Option `.includeInactive` returns regions that exist but are not currently
active — useful for stable high-level decisions (for example, always preferring
an even column count on a device that *has* a fold).

Each region carries `frame`, `isActive` (`active` in Objective-C), `kind`, an
`id`/`identifier`, and **`margins`** (`EdgeInsets` / `UIEdgeInsets`). ⚠ Per the
reference, `frame` **already includes** the margins — they are the part of the
frame kept clear for interactive content. Avoiding `frame` is enough; don't add
`margins` on top. Inset `frame` by `margins` to get the bare hardware area,
which is what full-bleed media may run up to. The margins property is not
mentioned in the Tech Talks.

⚠ The reference also says the query returns every region that intersects the
view *regardless* of whether it is active, which sits oddly beside the
`.includeInactive` option. Always filter on `isActive` for current-state
decisions rather than relying on the default options.

Safe areas and layout margins on iPhone Duo are frequently **asymmetric**. Never
assume opposite insets are equal.

## Arrangements (iOS 27.1)

A layout container that sits between navigation containers and content
containers, arranging exactly two views by rule.

| Job | SwiftUI | UIKit |
|---|---|---|
| Container | `ArrangementView(primary:secondary:)` | `UIArrangementViewController`, ⚠ `setViewController(_:for:animated:)` |
| Choose style | `.arrangementViewStyle(some ArrangementViewStyle)` | ⚠ `updateArrangement(_:animated:)` with `UISplitArrangement` / `UIOverlayArrangement` |
| Constrain split axis | `.split.axes(.horizontal)` | `.axes(.horizontal)` on the arrangement |
| Read overlay stacking | `@Environment(\.overlayArrangementZIndex)` | `state(for:)` → `ViewState.zIndex` |
| Look up a placement | — | `viewController(for:)`, `placement(for:)` |

⚠ Both UIKit mutators take an `animated:` parameter. The Tech Talks show them
without it.

SwiftUI declaration: `struct ArrangementView<Primary, Secondary> where Primary:
View, Secondary: View`, with `init(primary:secondary:)`.

- **split** — divides the bounds between primary and secondary. Splits
  horizontally when wider than tall, vertically when taller than wide. For
  main/detail relationships where neither view should be obscured.
- **overlay** — prefers stacking content above/below, moving to side-by-side
  when folded. For clear foreground/background relationships.

Do **not** put navigation containers (e.g. `NavigationSplitView`) inside an
arrangement, and do **not** put an arrangement inside `List` or `ScrollView`.

## Bars on the vertical axis

Opt in by rebuilding against the latest SDK **and** using container-provided
bars. Content from a hand-rolled `UIToolbar`, `UINavigationBar` or `UITabBar` is
not considered.

| Job | SwiftUI | UIKit |
|---|---|---|
| Custom back/close | `cancellationAction` placement | leading item, `leftItemsSupplementBackButton = false` |
| Prominent action | `topBarPinnedTrailing` placement | `pinnedTrailingGroup` |
| Force an axis | `AxisBehavior` (horizontal-only / vertical) | `AxisBehavior` |
| Detect a vertical bar | `toolbarVerticalEdge` environment value | `toolbarVerticalEdge` trait |
| Consolidate overflow | `ToolbarOverflowMenu` | `UINavigationItem.additionalOverflowItems` |
| Control collapse order | `ToolbarItemVisibilityPriority` | `UIBarButtonItemVisibilityPriority` |
| Group items (instead of manual spacers) | `ToolbarItemGroup` | `UIBarButtonItemGroup` |
| Title + symbol on an item | `Label` | `UIBarButtonItem` |
| Toolbar vs tab bar compression | toolbar compression behavior | toolbar compression behavior |
| Turn vertical bars off | `toolbarVerticalBehavior` | `preferredVerticalBarBehavior` |
| Tab bar as sidebar | default tab bar placement → `.sidebar` | tab bar controller sidebar preferred placement → `.sidebar` |
| Badges (iOS 26) | badge API | badge API |

**Availability differs within this table, which matters when setting a
deployment target.** The toolbar APIs are older than the foldable-specific ones:

| Symbol | Introduced |
|---|---|
| `ToolbarItemVisibilityPriority` (`.automatic` / `.low` / `.high`, plus `init(higherThan:)` / `init(lowerThan:)`) | iOS 27.0 |
| `UIBarButtonItemVisibilityPriority` (`.standard` / `.low` / `.high`, plus `init(rawValue:)`) | iOS 27.0 |
| `ToolbarOverflowMenu` | iOS 27.0 |
| `toolbarVerticalEdge` | **iOS 27.1** |

⚠ `toolbarVerticalEdge` is a `HorizontalEdge?` reporting the system's *preferred*
edge for a vertical bar in the current context — **whether or not one is
visible**. It is not a flag for "are items vertical right now"; use it to align
your own custom bars with the system's placement.

Note the naming asymmetry: SwiftUI's default is `.automatic`, UIKit's is
`.standard`.

## Hinge and scenes

| Job | SwiftUI | UIKit |
|---|---|---|
| Observe the hinge | `onHingeChange` modifier | `UIHingeInteraction` |
| Request a new scene | — | `UIWindowSceneActivation` action |
| Pair UI to another display | `sceneAccessory` modifier | scene accessory API |
| Outer-display camera UI | `CameraCaptureAccessory` | `CameraCaptureAccessory` |
| React to accessory availability | `onAvailabilityChange` | observation tracking |

SwiftUI, verbatim:

```swift
nonisolated func onHingeChange(
    isEnabled: Bool = true,
    _ action: @escaping (DeviceHingeContext, DeviceHingeContext) -> Void
) -> some View
```

The closure gets the previous and current `DeviceHingeContext`. Its `hinge` is a
`DeviceHinge?` — `nil` means the device has no hinge. `DeviceHinge` exposes
`angle: Angle` and `status: DeviceHinge.Status`. ⚠ `DeviceHinge.Status` is a
**struct** with static members `.closed`, `.partiallyOpen`, `.fullyOpen`
(Equatable and Hashable), not an enum — a `switch` over it needs `default`.

In UIKit the shape is different from the SwiftUI modifier and worth reading
directly. `UIHingeInteraction` takes an update handler with **two arguments, the
interaction and an `Update`** — not a previous/current pair — and has an
`isEnabled` flag:

```swift
init(updateHandler: (UIHingeInteraction, UIHingeInteraction.Update) -> Void)
```

`Update.hinge` is a `UIHinge?`, `nil` when the interaction leaves a hierarchy
that provides hinge updates. The handler fires on hinge changes **and** when the
interaction moves between hierarchies. `UIHinge` exposes `angle: CGFloat` —
⚠ **in radians** — and `status: UIHinge.Status`, an `Int`-backed enum with
⚠ **four** cases: `.closed`, `.partiallyOpen`, `.fullyOpen` and `.unknown`.
All of these types are iOS 27.1.

What the reference says about the values:

- The status is determined by the system from the angle **and device
  orientation** — don't recompute it from angle thresholds.
- The rate and granularity of angle updates are system policy and can change —
  don't depend on a frequency or precision.
- If closed / partially open / fully open is all you need, prefer `status`.
- The angle range is not documented; don't assume flat is exactly 180°.

Use the hinge for **interactions and effects**. Use arrangements and reserved
regions for **layout**.

New windows cannot be created while on the outer display — that is reserved for
the inner display. Handle scene-request failures, and prefer
`UIWindowSceneActivation`, which hides itself when new windows are unavailable.

## Camera (AVFoundation / AVKit)

| Job | API |
|---|---|
| Discover a front camera | `AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession`, position `.front`, Wide or Ultra Wide device type → resolves to the **virtual front camera** |
| Address one physical camera | built-in **outer** ultra-wide device type; built-in **inner** ultra-wide device type |
| Track which way cameras face | `AVCaptureDeviceDirectionCoordinator` (AVKit) |
| Read the current facing | `deviceDirections` on the coordinator, or the map passed to the change handler |
| Group cameras by facing | ⚠ `AVCaptureDeviceDirectionMap` (AVKit) |
| Pass a device across actors | `AVCaptureDeviceDescriptor` (AVKit) — sendable |
| Keep captures upright | `AVCaptureDeviceRotationCoordinator` |
| Fit the preview | `videoGravity` on `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` |
| Use the square sensor fully | `dynamicAspectRatio` on `AVCaptureDevice` |

The direction coordinator is main-actor isolated and reports facing **relative to
the display its view is on**. Use one coordinator per view when you drive both
displays at once.

```swift
init(view: UIView,
     deviceTypes: [AVCaptureDevice.DeviceType],
     changeHandler: ((AVCaptureDeviceDirectionMap) -> Void)?)
```

⚠ The handler receives an **`AVCaptureDeviceDirectionMap`**, not a descriptor.
The map holds two arrays — `forwardFacingDeviceDescriptors` and
`backwardFacingDeviceDescriptors` — so your handler picks a descriptor rather
than being handed one. The same map is readable any time via `deviceDirections`.

An `AVCaptureDeviceDescriptor` carries `uniqueID`, `localizedName`, `deviceType`,
`mediaTypes` and `position`. Both it and the map live in **AVKit**, not
AVFoundation.

Virtual front camera trade-off: automatic switching, but only the capabilities
common to both physical cameras — 1080p, 60 fps, and **no depth**.
